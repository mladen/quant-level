# Quant level (this is the working title, it may change)

## Description

Quant level is a project that helps with analyzing and predicting stock prices. The project will be built using:

- Python, Django(?)
- SQLite(?) or PostgreSQL(?)
- Vue.js(?)

## Features

- Stocks prediction
- Stock price analysis
- Stocks portfolio ?

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: v0.1

- Basic app functionality:
  - Price history download: Implement functionality to download historical stock prices from the stock exchange API.
    - We will use the [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) [API](https://www.tradingview.com/rest-api-spec/) (optional [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) [API](https://developer.yahoo.com/api/)) to download historical stock prices.
      - NOTE: Whichever API we choose, we will need to understand the API's rate limits and data availibility to manage data retrieval efficiently.
  - Data preprocessing: Clean and process the downloaded data for further analysis.
    - We will need to handle missing data, outliers, and other data quality issues (formatting issues in the downloaded data).
      - NOTE: Check if TradingView API will provide clean data. If not, we'll create functions and classes specifically for data preprocessing to keep the code clean and maintainable.

### Phase 2: v0.2

- Data analysis:
  - Implementation of Basic technical indicators
    - Calculate and display basic technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), etc.
      - NOTE: We should ensure that our analysis/calculation functions are modular and can be easily extended to incorporate more complex indicators in future phases etc.
  - Correlation analysis: Analyze correlations between different stocks and market indices.
    - Use statistical methods (e.g. Pearson correlation coefficient) to analyze the relationship between different stocks and market indices.
      - NOTE: We should consider the scalability of our correlation analysis functions to handle a large number of stocks and indices. Well, maybe for now we should just focus on a few stocks and indices to keep things simple.
      - NOTE: We should also consider the visualization (using heatmaps or something\*) of the correlation analysis results to make it easier for users to interpret the results.

* We can check what Vue.js has to offer for data visualization.

# Phase 3: v0.3

- Strategy development:
  - Design a simple trading strategy: Develop a basic trading strategy (e.g. moving average) based on the analyzed data.
    - NOTE: Check out SMA (Simple Moving Average), EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and weighted moving average (WMA) for moving average strategies. Check out ÇŒhat moving average crossover is.
  - Testing: Test the trading strategy using historical data to evaluate the application's performance.
    - NOTE: We should consider implementing a backtesting framework to evaluate the strategy's historical performance accurately. Check how we can implement this in Python.
    - NOTE: Develope tests for our trading strategy to validate its effectivenes under various market conditions? (optional)

# Phase 4: v0.4

- Risk management:
  - Implementation of basic risk management techniques: Incorporate risk management principles such as stop-loss orders, etc.
  - Fine-tuning: Optimize trading strategy parameters to improve custom risk and returns.

# Phase 5: v1.0 (Final version)

- Additional functionalities:
  - Data streaming and real-time trading simulation.
  - User interface enhancement: Improve the user interface for better usability and visualization of trading signals.
